Individual\nmatchers within a set work the same (i.e. different matchers in\nthe same set are AND'ed).\n\nNOTE: The generated docs which describe the structure of this\nmodule are wrong because of how this type unmarshals JSON in a\ncustom way. The correct structure is:\n\n```json\n[\n\t{},\n\t{}\n]\n```\n\nwhere each of the array elements is a matcher set, i.e. an\nobject keyed by matcher name.\n"
