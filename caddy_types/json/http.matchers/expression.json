Please refer to\n[the standard definitions of CEL functions and operators](https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md#standard-definitions).\n\nThis matcher's JSON interface is actually a string, not a struct.\nThe generated docs are not correct because this type has custom\nmarshaling logic.\n\nCOMPATIBILITY NOTE: This module is still experimental and is not\nsubject to Caddy's compatibility guarantee.\n"
