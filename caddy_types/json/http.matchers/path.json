Path\nmatches are exact, but wildcards may be used:\n\n- At the end, for a prefix match (`/prefix/*`)\n- At the beginning, for a suffix match (`*.suffix`)\n- On both sides, for a substring match (`*/contains/*`)\n- In the middle, for a globular match (`/accounts/*/info`)\n\nThis matcher is fast, so it does not support regular expressions or\ncapture groups. For slower but more powerful matching, use the\npath_regexp matcher.\n"
